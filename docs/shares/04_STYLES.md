# Styles (Collections?)

Styles are custom CSS rules that can override existing CSS and elements, or define new classes to work with.

## Runtime

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/bundle.css" />
```

## Dependencies

When you re-style existing lists, items, pages, components, layouts or headers, you can reference them, so users can add
your style and dependant components at the same time.

## Note

Styles (Collections) are meant for reusable CSS only.

## All collections

See [all collections on Comms Hub](https://hub.comms.dev/)
